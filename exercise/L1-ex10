    Please perform the following tasks individually

    Modify the file in the working tree at your pleasure using
        git diff HEAD~m Lines.txt
        git log --oneline
        git restore --sources HEAD~n Lines.txt
    where m and n are integers of your liking, including 0
    Here, the command order is solely alphabetical: make your choices
    
    REQUIRED for the continuation (but not as a rule)
        1. NEVER STAGE OR COMMIT 
        2. Make sure that you finish with a clean working tree at HEAD

    Formulate your own explanation of what you see
    The following questions are two sides of the same coin:
        What did you ask Git to do?
        What did Git do for you?
    Are there shortcuts to do the same with less typing?
