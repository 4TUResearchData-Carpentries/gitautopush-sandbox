    Lesson 1 Episode 3 --- Explore the changes recorded in the history
    Please perform the following tasks individually

    The baseline
        1a. Check that the history has 5 commits
        1b. Check that the file has 7 lines

    The action
        Explain to yourself the difference **between** the outputs of
        these two commands:

            git diff HEAD~3 HEAD~4 Lines.txt

	        git diff HEAD~3 HEAD~4

    What is the reason of the (lack of) difference between the outputs?
