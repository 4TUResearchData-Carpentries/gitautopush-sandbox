    Lesson 1 Episode 3 --- Add lightweight tags to the history
    Please perform the following tasks individually

    It is good code-development practice to attribute a version number 
    to important commits
    
    1. Attach the version v1, v2, v3, and so on to each commit in your
    history
        Use annotated tags if you like: in that case DON'T forget a 
        message (for example, one helping you recall what we were
        studying then)  
    2. Verify the outcome of tagging with three Git commands, 
       namely ..., ..., and ...

    Formulate your own explanation of what you have observed

    The following questions are two sides of the same coin:
        What did you ask Git to do?
        What did Git do for you?
