## Introduction

This report uses the **tidyverse** package along with the *SAFI*
dataset which has columns that include:

- village
  + Name of village
- interview_date
  + Date of interview
    * another detail
- no_members
- years_liv

These are my favourite:

1. village
2. rooms
3. meals thing
4. some other column
