# Notes of the Software Carpentry Workshop

_To whom this may concern._

#### Content

Here you find the "lesson notes", that is the commands that the instructors type during the workshop lessons.  
During each lesson, these commands are continuously appended to a file whose name starts with `python`, `unixshell`, and `git`.  
(Files may have different extension according to the lesson, never mind that.)

#### Usage

1. Use the lesson notes when you had to lag behind the instructor and need to catch up with the instructions.  
Consider that instructors may not follow the on-line lesson material verbatim.  
So, referring to these notes may be more helpful and effective than browsing the Carpentries lesson material.  
2. In the list of files above, bring up the file of your lesson upon clicking _exactly on the file name_ (hence not anywhere else in the line).  
3. Please refresh the webpage with the lesson notes. So, you will view the latest commands as the instructor types and the notes grow.
