# Notes of the Software Carpentry Workshop 22-25 May 2023

Here you find the commands that the instructors type during the workshop lessons, called the "notes".  

Use them when you had to lag behind the instructor and need to catch up with the instructions.  
Consider that instructors may not follow the on-line lesson material verbatim.  
So referring to these notes may be more helpful and effective.  

The commands of each lesson are contained in a file whose name starts with `python`, `unixshell`, and `git`.  
(Files may have different extension according to the lesson, never mind this.)

Bring up the file of your lesson upon clicking exactly on the file name in the list above -- hence not anywhere else in the line.  
Remember to refresh the webpage often to view the latest commands as the notes grow.
