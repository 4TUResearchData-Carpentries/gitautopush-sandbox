# Notes of the Software Carpentry Workshop 

**When** 5-8 Feb 2024  
**Where** Delft University of Technology

_To whom this may concern._


## Content
Collection of learner materials for a Software Carpentries workshop. 
These materials are adaptations from the lessons provided by the [Software  Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/).

Here you find the "lesson notes", that is the commands that instructors type during the workshop lessons. 
Please take note that some instructors may have preferred another way to share their lesson note; please do refer to their indication in the class.

#### Setup for instructors 

With the following lines you (as istructor) copy only the branch of this one workshop in a directory where you call `gitautopush`

    git clone git@github.com:4TUResearchData-Carpentries/workshop_notes.git --branch 2402-SCW-TUD --single-branch gitautopushed
    cd gitautopushed
    gitautopush .  # YOU MUST HAVE HAD AT LEAST ONE PUSH TO THE REMOTE BRANCH BEFORE USING THE GITAUTOPUSH
    jupyter lab  # For Phyton instructors (read on below) 

Whether you can run the class typing away in this one directory, depends on which lesson you are giving. 
In cases, you may need to redirect here the output you want to share.
Look up the detailed explanation in https://github.com/4TUResearchData-Carpentries/workshop_notes/tree/master#3-preparations-for-coordinatorsinstructors

#### Usage for workshop participants

1. Use the lesson notes when you had to lag behind the instructor and need to catch up with the instructions. 
Consider that instructors may not follow the on-line lesson material verbatim.  So, referring to these notes may be more helpful and effective than browsing the Carpentries lesson material.  
2. In the list of files above this text, bring up the file of your lesson upon clicking _exactly on the file name_ (hence not anywhere else in the line).  
3. Please refresh the webpage with the lesson notes. 
So, you will view the latest commands as the instructor types and the notes grow.
