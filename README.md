## Type-along notes, per lesson

The commands that the instructors type on the screen during each lesson will be appended to the documents **name convention.md** found at the top of this page.

Please use these lesson notes when you had to lag behind the instructor and need to catch up with the instructions. 

In the list of files above, bring up the file of your lesson upon clicking _exactly on the file name_ (hence not anywhere else in the line). If that page has been parked for some time, please refresh it with your browser (typically, hit `F5`). So, you will view the latest commands as the instructor types and the notes grow.
