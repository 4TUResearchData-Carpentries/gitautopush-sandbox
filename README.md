## 2. Type-along notes, per lesson

The commands the instructors type on the screen during each lesson will be appended continuously to the documents **Lesson\*.md** found at the top of this web page (_above_ this document).

Please use these lesson notes when you had to lag behind the instructor and need to catch up with the instructions. Bring up the file of the lesson upon clicking _exactly on the file name_ (to the right, hence not anywhere else in the line). 

Please refresh the page with the lesson notes in your browser (typically, hit `F5`). So, you will view the latest commands as the notes grow.


<!-- After the end of the lesson the instructors will decorate the type-along notes with the division in Chapters and Episodes -->
